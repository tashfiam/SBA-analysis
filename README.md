# SBA-analysis
Can we accurately predict if loan will be defaulted or paid in full?

Steps:
1. We read our data and clean it
2. We encode it to fit ML model
3. We will try to use this data to train and test a few classification models and see which one works best
4. After choosing best performing model, we will try to optimize it with hyper parameter tuning
