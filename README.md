# SBA-analysis
Can we accurately predict if loan will be defaulted or paid in full?

Steps:
1. We read our data and clean it. We check for NA values.
2. We encode categorical variables using WOE encoding to fit ML model.
3. We will try to use this data to train and test a few classification models and see which one works best. 
4. After choosing best performing model, we will try to optimize it with hyper parameter tuning
